## Gripen interface design

My team evaluated the hardware and interfaces in use in the cockpit of a SAAB Gripen fighter jet for the Perception Theory course of my Masters. We recommended design improvements to their 2D interface, as well as some things they could try in 3D and 2.5D (with a big disclaimer that 3D interfaces are especially difficult to implement effectively).

I also flew the flight simulator... :)
