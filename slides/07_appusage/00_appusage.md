## AppUsage

We built a script and API, similar to Google Analytics, that developers can add to their applications to track the number of **unique** users that visit their site.

The problem this solves: app owners at Intel are supposed to provide the number of users their application has. This number is used to justify resourcing. However, because there was no automation in place, this number was a human guess, which is not ideal.

Since we had the data, we also provided app owners with reports and segmentation analysis. The key to getting adoption is to not just solve a problem for the business, but also to solve a problem for the end user.

This is not nearly polished as our other apps, but it was a side project and we had limited time.
