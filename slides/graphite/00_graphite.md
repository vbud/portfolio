## GraphITE

My role in GraphITE was to build a front-end for impact analysis and reporting over a graph database of IT software, application, and hardware data. The more interesting front-end work was the data searching/crawling interface and the impact analysis interface.

In addition to the screenshots of GraphITE prototypes and web application in the children slides, you can also check out [the wireframes](slides/graphite/graphite-mocks.pdf) from when I was thinking through the design.
